// Post-parse AST transformation pass.
// Mirrors parser.js's processAST/seekParent/pushAncestry/resolveAncestry
// (tests/jsonata-js/src/parser.js ~L937-1235), adapted to Rust's ownership
// model: instead of mutating tree nodes in place, this consumes the raw
// tree and rebuilds an enriched one with ancestor/tuple metadata resolved.
//
// ── Recursion-depth safety (the invariant this file must preserve) ──────────
//
// `parser::parse()` pipes every parse through `resolve_ancestry`, so a deeply
// nested input can overflow the native stack HERE even when the Pratt parse
// succeeded (confirmed empirically with a 200,000-term `1+1+1+...` chain).
// See docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-07-parser-depth-and-u16-truncation-fixes-plan.md
// for the full derivation. The rules, in short:
//
// 1. There are three recursive cycles but only TWO independent stack budgets.
//    Cycle 1 (transform_node / transform_children / transform_path_steps /
//    migrate_binding_markers) and cycle 3 (walk_backward / seek_parent_step /
//    seek_parent_wrapped) nest on the SAME native stack — cycle 3 is reached
//    while cycle 1's frames are live — so they must share ONE depth counter.
//    Cycle 2 (substitute_labels) runs only after cycle 1 has fully unwound
//    and gets its own counter.
//
// 2. Dropping an abandoned deep subtree recurses in the Drop glue,
//    independently of any depth counter. Every owning bail-out (an `Err`
//    return that still holds a subtree) must dismantle it iteratively via
//    `push_ast_node_children`, never let it fall out of scope. That function
//    deliberately has no `_` wildcard arm so a new AST variant cannot
//    silently opt out.
//

// --- Recursion-depth safety (Task 2 of the plan referenced in the module
// doc comment above) ---
//
// Two INDEPENDENT depth counters, per the module doc comment's analysis:
// one shared by cycle 1 (transform_node/transform_children/
// transform_path_steps/migrate_binding_markers) AND cycle 3
// (walk_backward/seek_parent_step/seek_parent_wrapped) -- because cycle 3 is
// reached from WITHIN live cycle-1 stack frames, their depths add and must
// share one counter -- and a second, wholly separate counter for
// substitute_labels (cycle 2), which only ever runs after cycle 1/3 have
// fully unwound (see `resolve_ancestry`). Do NOT let these two counters
// influence each other.
//
// A LATER guard was added directly in `parser.rs` (`MAX_PARSE_DEPTH`, also
// 1000) that bounds the parser's OWN recursion/loop-iteration counter --
// this is NOT the same thing as "real AST tree depth is always <=1000".
// Calibrated empirically (throwaway harness, this session) across several
// shapes: for simple ones (flat Binary/Unary/Array/Object chains) the
// parser's counter tracks real tree depth 1:1, so `ast_transform`'s own
// ceiling below fires first, well before the parser's. But for COMPOUND
// shapes where one parser-guarded call/iteration corresponds to more than
// one real `AstNode`-nesting hop (e.g. `a.(a.(a.(...)))`, where each level
// costs one recursive `parse_expression` call for the `FunctionApplication`
// body PLUS the `Path` wrapper it returns into), real tree depth reachable
// via a parser-accepted expression can run up to ~2x the parser's own
// counter value (observed: parser counter 999 -> real tree depth 2000).
// This means DO NOT assume "the parser already bounds real depth to
// <=1000" as a reason to raise this file's ceiling to just above 1000 --
// that reasoning is unsound for compound shapes and was corrected before
// shipping (see PR discussion). This file's own ceiling stays genuinely
// load-bearing for those shapes, not just cosmetic defense-in-depth.
//
// Ceiling rationale: chosen empirically (see
// `test_deeply_nested_arithmetic_does_not_overflow_native_stack_at_parse_time`
// and `test_reasonable_nesting_still_parses_successfully` in
// tests/integration_test.rs) to be comfortably safe on a 1MB-stack thread
// (matching Windows' default, the same constraint `evaluate_internal`'s
// analogous guard in evaluator.rs was built for). `stacker::maybe_grow`
// below helps DURING this file's own guarded traversal, but it is NOT the
// only thing keeping this ceiling load-bearing:
//
// A tree that successfully passes this guard (returns `Ok` all the way out
// of `parser::parse()`) is handed to whatever caller holds it next (the
// evaluator, the Python `JsonataExpression`, a test's local variable) and
// is eventually dropped there via Rust's ORDINARY recursive `Drop` glue --
// NOT the iterative teardown this file uses on its own bail-out path (see
// `push_ast_node_children`'s doc comment below). Confirmed empirically this
// session: simply constructing then normally-dropping a `Box<AstNode>`
// chain somewhere between ~5,000 and ~20,000 levels deep overflows a
// 1MB-stack thread, with ZERO ast_transform code involved. This ceiling
// (1000, i.e. at most ~1000 levels of ACTUAL AST nesting, since cycle 1
// costs >=1 depth unit per level) stays far enough below that downstream
// threshold that any successfully-returned tree is safe for a caller to
// drop normally. RAISING this ceiling without separately re-verifying the
// downstream-drop threshold would silently reintroduce a native-stack
// crash on the SUCCESS path -- a different crash than the one this task
// fixes, and not exercised by either test above (one only exercises the
// bail path at n=200,000; the other only exercises a SHALLOW successful
// tree, not a near-ceiling one).
const MAX_TRANSFORM_DEPTH: usize = crate::runtime::MAX_PARSE_DEPTH;

// AST nesting (2 units for a Binary/Unary/etc. level via the
// transform_node+transform_children pair, but exactly 1 unit for a level
// that's pure nested blocks/parens, e.g. `((((...))))`, which only ever
// enters transform_node's Block arm -- no transform_children hop). For
// THAT shape, this counter and MAX_TRANSFORM_DEPTH are checking the exact
// same per-level cost, so a tree that just barely passes cycle 1 (depth
// ~1000) can arrive at substitute_labels already ~1000 deep too -- zero
// margin, not 2x. It's still safe (substitute_labels's own bail-out lets
// its `node` drop normally, unlike cycle 1/3's iterative-teardown bail
// path, but by the time cycle 2 runs, cycle 1 already guaranteed the tree
// is <= this same ceiling deep, well below the ~5,000-20,000-level
// downstream-drop threshold noted above) -- just not defended by a margin,
// so don't raise this independently of MAX_TRANSFORM_DEPTH without
// re-checking this reasoning.

// `check_label_substitution_depth` trips inside `transform_node`/
// `transform_children`/`transform_path_steps`, that function's OWN
// `node`/`steps` parameter can still hold an ENORMOUS unprocessed remainder
// (we bail out before ever destructuring it -- e.g. a `1+1+1+...` chain 200
// levels past the ceiling still has ~199,800 more nested `Binary` levels
// hanging off the node we're about to return `Err` for). If we just let
// that `node`/`steps` value drop normally as the function returns, Rust's
// compiler-generated recursive `Drop` glue walks the WHOLE remaining chain
// one native stack frame per nesting level -- completely bypassing the
// depth counter above, since that glue isn't a function call this file
// controls. Confirmed empirically, independent of any ast_transform code:
// simply constructing then normally-dropping a ~20,000-deep `Box<AstNode>`
// chain overflows a 1MB-stack thread outright.
//
// The fix is an explicit heap work-list (`Vec<AstNode>`) instead of the
// call stack: pop one node, move its `Box<AstNode>`/`Vec<AstNode>`/
// `Vec<PathStep>` children onto the list (dropping only that one node's own
// shallow, non-recursive fields for free as the match arm's temporaries go
// out of scope), repeat. Stack usage is O(1) regardless of how deep the
// abandoned remainder is, because no recursive function call (guarded or
// not) is ever made -- only a `while` loop over a heap-allocated `Vec`.
//
// Every function that OWNS an `AstNode`/`Vec<PathStep>`/`PathStep`
// parameter and can bail out with that parameter's traversal still
// incomplete (`transform_node`, `transform_children`, `transform_path_steps`,
// and -- for the `step.stages` a step still carries when its OWN `.node`
// fails to transform -- `migrate_binding_markers`) must route the abandoned
// value through here instead of letting it drop implicitly. Anything that
// already came back out of a SUCCESSFUL (`Ok`) call is guaranteed
// depth-bounded (that call would have hit the guard above otherwise) and is
